  bio:
    academic: >
      I am an exoplanet researcher with an odd niche in the yield modeling exoplanet
      community. Currently I'm a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow (which means I'm
      actually an affiliate of Oak Ridge Associated Universities and not a NASA
      employee for some reason) at NASA Goddard working with Chris Stark on
      coronagraph simulations and yield modeling.

      I did my PhD at Cornell University with Dmitry Savransky where I worked on
      EXOSIMS, the Roman Exposure Time Calculator, and how precursor RV surveys can
      inform scheduling future direct imaging observations. My PhD was in Aerospace
      engineering with a minor in Astronomy and I don't know at if I'm an engineer in
      astronomy or an astronomer who knows a weird amount of controls.

      In undergrad at Virginia Tech I did research with Jonathan Boreyko on
      out-of-plane dry zones created by droplets. Additionally, I was pooped on by a
      flying snake in the course of another research project. That is a true
      statement.
    
    industry: >
      I am a postdoctoral researcher at NASA Goddard. I've been trained as an
      engineer, physicist, and software developer who specializes in
      astrophysics applications and optimization. I develop simulation software
      for exoplanet detection missions and create optimized Python libraries
      for scientific computing using JAX and NumPy.

      I completed my Aerospace Engineering PhD at Cornell University, with
      training in advanced dynamics and controls. My dissertation created
      novel observation scheduling algorithms for a future NASA flagship
      mission.
