  - title: "EXOSIMS - Exoplanet Imaging Mission Simulator"
    description: |
      Core developer of EXOSIMS, an open-source Python framework for simulating 
      exoplanet direct imaging missions. The software is used by NASA to evaluate 
      and optimize future space telescope designs and observation strategies.
      My contributions include performance optimizations, new scheduling algorithms,
      and integration with modern coronagraph models.

  - title: "yippy - PSF Interpolation with JAX"
    description: |
      Created a high-performance Python library for interpolating coronagraph 
      point spread functions using Fourier interpolation techniques. Built with 
      JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, achieving 100x 
      speedups over traditional methods.

  - title: "orbix - Ultra-Fast Kepler Equation Solver"
    description: |
      Developed an extremely optimized solver for Kepler's equation using JAX.
      Features automatic differentiation, vectorization, and JIT compilation,
      making it ideal for large-scale orbit propagation and optimization problems
      in mission design.

  - title: "RVtoImaging - Precursor Science Integration"
    description: |
      Built a comprehensive simulation framework that models the collection of
      radial velocity precursor data and optimizes direct imaging observation
      scheduling. Combines Python for high-level logic with C extensions for
      computational bottlenecks.
