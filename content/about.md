I am an exoplanet researcher with an odd niche in the yield modeling exoplanet
community. Currently I'm a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow (which means I'm
actually an affiliate of Oak Ridge Associated Universities and not a NASA
employee for some reason) at NASA Goddard working with Chris Stark on
coronagraph simulations and yield modeling.

I did my PhD at Cornell University with Dmitry Savransky where I worked on
EXOSIMS, the Roman Exposure Time Calculator, and how precursor RV surveys can
inform scheduling future direct imaging observations. My PhD was in Aerospace
engineering with a minor in Astronomy and I don't know at if I'm an engineer in
astronomy or an astronomer who knows a weird amount of controls.

In undergrad at Virginia Tech I did research with Jonathan Boreyko on
out-of-plane dry zones created by droplets and worked with flying snakes.
